This is an optional project that was done with "The Web Developer Bootcamp" though Udemy, however I was getting lots of error messages when following the exact code so ended up building it all in js instead of using paperjs. I did however use the Howlerjs mp3 that were provided.

Getting Started
If you want to use this code it will be easy to use, without any special libraries, however to use the Howl I recommend to go to https://howlerjs.com/ to download the sound.
